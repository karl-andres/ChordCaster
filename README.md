# About the Project

ChordCaster is an Arduino-based assistive device designed to help visually and hearing-impaired individuals play guitar independently. Originally created for Kimberly, a woman with Usher Syndrome, ChordCaster allows real-time chord progression playback using tactile buttons and audio feedback â€” removing the need for visual interfaces or multiple apps.

## Problem Statement

Kimberly, who experiences tunnel vision, limited color perception, and hearing difficulties due to Usher Syndrome, wanted to enjoy playing the guitar without relying on visual cues. Our goal was to enhance her ability to play music in a safe, independent, and joyful way.
